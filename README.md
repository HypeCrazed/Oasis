# Oasis

Oasis allows you to launch old versions of Rec Room by bypassing the game's update check.

The bypass works by renaming the Steam file to a different name, so it can't open to check for updates and Rec Room just skips the step and launches anyway.

You will need to download the old versions of the game using the Steam console.
